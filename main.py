# Problem 76:
#     Counting Summations
#
# Description:
#     It is possible to write five as a sum in exactly six different ways:
#         4 + 1
#         3 + 2
#         3 + 1 + 1
#         2 + 2 + 1
#         2 + 1 + 1 + 1
#         1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
#
#     How many different ways can one hundred be written as a sum of at least two positive integers?

    #       meaning the partition of `n` into just one part, (n), is not counted,

    #       rather than some constrained set of values.
